"""Auto-recall - zero-cooperation memory injection.

PMB's biggest UX problem: the agent has to remember to call `recall` /
`prepare` / `project_overview`. It often doesn't. The Adherence dashboard
shows `prepare_rate` near 0% on most workspaces - instructions in
CLAUDE.md are good intentions, not enforcement.

This module fixes the dependency. It runs from the UserPromptSubmit hook
(`pmb hooks install`) and decides - without asking the model - which PMB
calls to pre-execute and inject as context. Pure regex intent
classification + parallel-safe dispatch over the engine. No LLM, no
network, no API keys. Sub-100ms p95 on a warm workspace.

Intents (multilingual, RU/UK/EN):

  PROJECT_PREP        a known project name + a work-verb (fix/add/refactor +
                      RU/UK equivalents). → full project_overview + arcs + goals.
  PROJECT_OVERVIEW    a known project name standalone. → project_overview.
  PAST_QUERY          "what did I / why did we" + RU/UK equivalents.
                      → recall(message).
  RECENT_QUERY        "what did I just / what are we doing now" + RU/UK.
                      → what_just_happened(5).
  GOALS_QUERY         "open goals / what's left" + RU/UK equivalents.
                      → list_goals(in_progress).
  LESSONS_QUERY       "what rules / lessons / conventions" + RU/UK.
                      → find_lessons(message).
  GENERIC_FACTUAL     question mark + non-trivial content, no other match.
                      → recall(message, top_k=3), surface only if score > 0.3.
  SKIP                trivial (greeting / ack / very short / pure-code).

Lessons are *always* surfaced (cheap, high value) in addition to whatever
intent fires. The CLI formats the result into a plain-text block that the
agent's host appends to the prompt.
